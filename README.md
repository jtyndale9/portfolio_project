## Problem Statement:
Since 2021, the cost of housing, and interest rates have skyrocketed. The decade of low cost housing and low interest rates following the 2008 economic crash has ended. This prices out many young buyers from the housing market, forcing them to rent, resulting in an inability to accumulate assets.

## Objective:
Create a place for young potential buyers to go to 1) check on the average cost of homes, 2) check on the current interest rates and 3) take a look at where my ML model will predict that the housing prices will go in the future. This will educate individuals and enable them with the knowledge to determine if buying property is realistic, and if it is a good time to do so.
